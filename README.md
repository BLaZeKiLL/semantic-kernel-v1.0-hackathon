# Semantic Kernel v1.0 Hackathon!

With the upcoming release of v1.0 for the [Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel), we want to do one big push and get the community hacking on our latest release candidate!

In our [last hackathon](https://partiful.com/e/RbwjXoM2LsgrLniprrLH), we challenged the community to build plugins for the Semantic Kernel.

This time around, we encourage you all to do the same, but with a focus on the v1.0 release candidate!

# SK Hackathon #2 (12/04/23 - 12/11/23) üì¢

**What:** Build a project using the latest Semantic Kernel SDK in your preferred language.

**When:** Submissions are open December 4, 2023 at 12 PM PST to December 11, 2023 at 12 PM PST.

**Why:** We are approaching a big milestone for the Semantic Kernel with the release of our 1.0 SDK. Before we do so, we want to make sure that we get as much community feedback as possible! And what better way to do this, than to do a hackathon!

**How:** Read the following resources to get familiar with the v1.0 SDK
- **Samples for Semantic Kernel v1 proposal** [(Repo)](https://github.com/matthewbolanos/sk-v1-proposal)
- **Semantic Kernel's Ignite release: Beta8 for the .NET SDK** [(Blog)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/semantic-kernel/semantic-kernels-ignite-release-beta8-for-the-net-sdk/)

# Plugins
Plugins are at the heart of unlocking more potential with your SK applications.
They allow you to connect to external data sources and give large language models tools to be able to
interact with native functions and API services.

### Want to test your plugins? ‚öóÔ∏è

If you want to try out your plugins and you do not have a ChatGPT plus subscription, you can test this directly **for free** using the Semantic Kernel!

See [this tutorial doc](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/ai-orchestration/chatgpt-plugins) or watch the [video](https://youtu.be/W_xF8PcdT78) for how to get set up.


## Criteria üöÄ üéÅ
We'll be judging submissions based off the following categories:
- **Most useful plugin for the enterprise**
- **Most fun and creative use of SK**

Prizes will be announced throughout the week. Some include an exclusive interview feature on the Semantic Kernel DevBlog and a customized Semantic Kernel T-Shirt. Stay tuned for more!
